## Quickstart

### Using Docker Compose

```yaml
version: "3.8"

services:
  api-gateway:
    build: ./api-gateway
    environment:
      - VAULT_ADDR=http://vault.lotabots.svc:8200
      - VAULT_ROLE=api-gateway
      - VAULT_NAMESPACE=lotabots
    ports:
      - "8080:8080"

  frontend:
    build: ./app
    ports:
      - "3000:3000"

	1.	Start the services:

docker-compose up


	2.	Access the application:
Once running, the API Gateway is available on port 8080, and the frontend on port 3000 by default.

Using Rust’s Cargo
	1.	Clone the repository:

git clone <repository-url>


	2.	Navigate to the project directory:

cd PROJECT-lota


	3.	Build and run the project:

cargo build
cargo run


	4.	Access the application:
By default, the service listens on port 8080 (configurable in your code or Cargo.toml).

Prerequisites and Compatibility
	•	Rust: Version 1.55 or higher
	•	Docker: Version 20.10 or higher
	•	Kubernetes: Version 1.21 or higher
	•	Platforms: Linux, macOS, Windows

	Note: Ensure you have the correct permissions on your system to run Docker and Kubernetes.

DevOps Workflows

Continuous Integration (ci.yml)
	•	Automated testing with PostgreSQL integration
Validate that your application functions as expected in conjunction with a PostgreSQL database.
	•	Code formatting checks (rustfmt)
Maintain a consistent code style across the project.
	•	Linting (clippy)
Catch common Rust pitfalls and enforce coding standards.
	•	Security auditing (cargo audit)
Check your dependencies and code for known vulnerabilities.
	•	Dependency review
Keep track of outdated libraries and make sure they’re up to date.

Continuous Deployment (cd.yml)
	•	Docker image building and pushing
Ensure a reproducible build pipeline for your Docker images.
	•	Automated deployment on tag releases
Trigger deployments whenever a new tag is pushed to the repository.
	•	Container registry integration
Publish images to Docker Hub, GitHub Container Registry, or another registry.
	•	Build caching for faster builds
Speed up build times by caching intermediate stages.

AIOps Automation (aiops.yml)
	•	Service health monitoring
Use built-in or custom metrics to continuously track service availability.
	•	Resource usage tracking
Monitor CPU, memory, and network usage to optimize performance.
	•	Log analysis with anomaly detection
Spot unusual behaviors or errors in logs.
	•	Predictive scaling
Scale the service up or down based on forecasted traffic.
	•	Automated alerting via Slack
Keep your team informed of any critical events or issues.

Setup
	1.	Configure GitHub Secrets
You must define the following secrets for your GitHub Actions:

SLACK_BOT_TOKEN - For alerts
DOCKER_USERNAME - For container registry
DOCKER_PASSWORD - For container registry


	2.	Install Python dependencies
Some scripts may require Python for tasks such as anomaly detection or predictive analytics:

cd scripts
pip install -r requirements.txt


	3.	Configure monitoring
	•	Update API endpoints in aiops.yml.
	•	Configure the Slack channel in aiops.yml.
	•	Adjust scaling thresholds in predict_scaling.py based on your expected traffic patterns.

Environment Variables and Secrets
	•	VAULT_ADDR
Vault server address. Default: http://vault.lotabots.svc:8200
	•	VAULT_ROLE
Kubernetes authentication role. Default: api-gateway
	•	VAULT_NAMESPACE
Vault namespace for secrets. Default: lotabots

	These can be customized or overridden based on your environment.

Development
	1.	Run tests:

cargo test


	2.	Check formatting:

cargo fmt --all -- --check


	3.	Run linter:

cargo clippy -- -D warnings


	4.	Security audit:

cargo audit

Deployment
	1.	Create a new release:

git tag v1.0.0
git push origin v1.0.0


	2.	Monitor deployment:
	•	Check GitHub Actions for CI/CD status.
	•	Verify that the container images are pushed to the registry.
	•	Monitor service health once deployed to Kubernetes or another environment.
