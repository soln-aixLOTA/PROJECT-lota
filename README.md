## Quickstart

### Using Docker Compose

```yaml
version: "3.8"

services:
  api-gateway:
    build: ./api-gateway
    environment:
      - VAULT_ADDR=http://vault.lotabots.svc:8200
      - VAULT_ROLE=api-gateway
      - VAULT_NAMESPACE=lotabots
    ports:
      - "8080:8080"

  frontend:
    build: ./app
    ports:
      - "3000:3000"
```

1. Start the services:

```bash
docker-compose up
```

2. Access the application:
   - The API Gateway is available on port 8080, and the frontend on port 3000 by default.

### Using Rust’s Cargo

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

```bash
cd PROJECT-lota
```

3. Build and run the project:

```bash
cargo build
cargo run
```

4. Access the application:
   - By default, the service listens on port 8080 (configurable in your code or Cargo.toml).

  - Trigger deployments whenever a new tag is pushed to the repository.
- **Container registry integration**
  - Publish images to Docker Hub, GitHub Container Registry, or another registry.
- **Build caching for faster builds**
  - Speed up build times by caching intermediate stages.

### AIOps Automation (aiops.yml)
- **Service health monitoring**
  - Use built-in or custom metrics to continuously track service availability.
- **Resource usage tracking**
  - Monitor CPU, memory, and network usage to optimize performance.
- **Log analysis with anomaly detection**
  - Spot unusual behaviors or errors in logs.
- **Predictive scaling**

## Setup

1. **Configure GitHub Secrets**
   - You must define the following secrets for your GitHub Actions:

```bash
SLACK_BOT_TOKEN - For alerts
DOCKER_USERNAME - For container registry
DOCKER_PASSWORD - For container registry
```

2. **Install Python dependencies**
   - Some scripts may require Python for tasks such as anomaly detection or predictive analytics:

```bash
cd scripts
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. **Configure monitoring**
   - Update API endpoints in `aiops.yml`.
   - Configure the Slack channel in `aiops.yml`.
   - Adjust scaling thresholds in `predict_scaling.py` based on your expected traffic patterns.

---

## Environment Variables and Secrets

- `VAULT_ADDR`
  - Vault server address. Default: `http://vault.lotabots.svc:8200`
- `VAULT_ROLE`
  - Kubernetes authentication role. Default: `api-gateway`
- `VAULT_NAMESPACE`
  - Vault namespace for secrets. Default: `lotabots`

*These can be customized or overridden based on your environment.*

---

## Development

1. **Run tests:**

```bash
cargo test
```

2. **Check formatting:**

```bash
cargo fmt --all -- --check
```

3. **Run linter:**

```bash
cargo clippy -- -D warnings
```

4. **Security audit:**

```bash
cargo audit
```

---

## Deployment

1. **Create a new release:**

```bash
git tag v1.0.0
git push origin v1.0.0
```

2. **Monitor deployment:**
   - Check GitHub Actions for CI/CD status.
   - Verify that the container images are pushed to the registry.
   - Monitor service health once deployed to Kubernetes or another environment.
