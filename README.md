## Quickstart

### Using Docker Compose

```yaml
version: '3.8'

services:
  api-gateway:
    build: ./api-gateway
    environment:
      - VAULT_ADDR=http://vault.lotabots.svc:8200
      - VAULT_ROLE=api-gateway
      - VAULT_NAMESPACE=lotabots
    ports:
      - "8080:8080"

  frontend:
    build: ./app
    ports:
      - "3000:3000"
```

To start the services, run:
```bash
docker-compose up
```

### Using Rustâ€™s Cargo

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone <repository-url>

# Navigate to the project directory
cd PROJECT-lota

# Build and run the project
cargo build
cargo run
```

## Prerequisites and Compatibility

- **Rust**: Version 1.55 or higher
- **Docker**: Version 20.10 or higher
- **Kubernetes**: Version 1.21 or higher
- **Platforms**: Linux, macOS, Windows

## DevOps Workflows

### Continuous Integration (ci.yml)

- **Automated testing with PostgreSQL integration**: Ensure your code works with PostgreSQL.
- **Code formatting checks (rustfmt)**: Maintain consistent code style.
- **Linting (clippy)**: Identify and fix potential issues in your code.
- **Security auditing (cargo audit)**: Check for security vulnerabilities.
- **Dependency review**: Keep your dependencies up to date.

### Continuous Deployment (cd.yml)

- **Docker image building and pushing**: Build and push Docker images automatically.
- **Automated deployment on tag releases**: Deploy your application on tag releases.
- **Container registry integration**: Integrate with container registries.
- **Build caching for faster builds**: Improve build times with caching.

### AIOps Automation (aiops.yml)

- **Service health monitoring**: Monitor the health of your services.
- **Resource usage tracking**: Track resource usage.
- **Log analysis with anomaly detection**: Detect anomalies in log data.
- **Predictive scaling**: Automatically scale your application based on predictions.
- **Automated alerting via Slack**: Receive alerts through Slack.

## Setup

1. **Configure GitHub Secrets**:
   ```bash
   SLACK_BOT_TOKEN - For alerts
   DOCKER_USERNAME - For container registry
   DOCKER_PASSWORD - For container registry
   ```

2. **Install Python dependencies**:
   ```bash
   cd scripts
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Configure monitoring**:
   - Update API endpoints in `aiops.yml`.
   - Configure Slack channel in `aiops.yml`.
   - Adjust scaling thresholds in `predict_scaling.py`.

## Environment Variables and Secrets

- `VAULT_ADDR`: Vault server address (default: `http://vault.lotabots.svc:8200`)
- `VAULT_ROLE`: Kubernetes authentication role (default: `api-gateway`)
- `VAULT_NAMESPACE`: Vault namespace for secrets (default: `lotabots`)

## Development

1. **Run tests**:
   ```bash
   cargo test
   ```

2. **Check formatting**:
   ```bash
   cargo fmt --all -- --check
   ```

3. **Run linter**:
   ```bash
   cargo clippy -- -D warnings
   ```

4. **Security audit**:
   ```bash
   cargo audit
   ```

## Deployment

1. **Create a new release**:
   ```bash
   git tag v1.0.0
   git push origin v1.0.0
   ```

2. **Monitor deployment**:
   - Check GitHub Actions.
   - Verify container registry.
   - Monitor service health.

## Troubleshooting Tips / FAQ

- **Authentication Failures**:
  - Verify the Kubernetes service account token is mounted.
  - Check the Vault role binding is correct.
  - Ensure network policies allow communication with Vault.
- **Secret Access Denied**:
  - Verify the Vault policy is correctly applied.
  - Check the secret path matches the policy.
  - Ensure the service account has the correct role binding.
- **Lease Renewal Failures**:
  - Check Vault server connectivity.
  - Verify the lease TTL is within allowed limits.
  - Ensure the policy allows lease renewal.
