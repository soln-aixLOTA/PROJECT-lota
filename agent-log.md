# Inference Service Development Log

## Date: 2024-07-26

### Model Repository Setup
- Created the basic structure for the model repository: `ai-services/inference/model_repository/my_model`.
- Decided to use a placeholder `model.plan` for the optimized TensorRT model initially.

### Model Optimization (Outline)
- Outlined the steps for optimizing a TensorFlow model using the TensorFlow-TensorRT integration.
- Noted the need for calibration data for INT8 optimization.

### `config.pbtxt` Creation
- Created the `config.pbtxt` file for `my_model`, defining input and output tensors, dynamic batching settings, and GPU instance.
- Referenced the Triton documentation for configuration options.

### Inference Client Implementation
- Implemented a basic Python client (`inference_client.py`) using the `tritonclient` library to send inference requests to the Triton server.
- Included an example of image preprocessing.

### API Endpoint Implementation
- Created a simple FastAPI application (`main.py`) to expose an `/infer` endpoint.
- The endpoint decodes a base64 encoded image, sends it to the Triton client, and returns the predictions.

### Dockerfile Creation
- Created a `Dockerfile` based on the NVIDIA Triton server image.
- Copied the model repository and the Python API code into the image.
- Installed necessary Python dependencies.
- Defined the command to start the FastAPI application.

### Testing Strategy
- Outlined the plan for unit tests, focusing on the client and the API.
- Described the integration tests involving deploying Triton and the API.

### Kubernetes Deployment (Outline)
- Created basic Kubernetes Deployment and Service manifests.
- Noted the need for GPU resources in the Deployment.

### Challenges
-  Simulating the output from the Training Service without direct access.
-  Choosing appropriate values for dynamic batching and other Triton configurations without specific performance data. This will require iterative testing and tuning.

### Next Steps
- Implement unit tests for the inference client and the FastAPI application.
- Set up a local test environment using Docker Compose to run integration tests.
- Further refine the Kubernetes deployment manifests, including resource requests and limits.
