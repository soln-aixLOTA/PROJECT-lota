# Security Policy

## Overview

The LotaBots platform implements multiple layers of security controls to ensure the integrity, confidentiality, and availability of AI operations and hardware attestation.

## Security Features

### Hardware Attestation Service

- **Container Security**

  - Mandatory SELinux enforcement
  - Seccomp profile requirements
  - Read-only root filesystem
  - Container Device Interface (CDI) for GPU access
  - Capability dropping and privilege restrictions
  - Mount point validation and security

- **Cloud Storage Security**
  - Encrypted data transfer
  - Access control through AWS IAM and Google Cloud IAM
  - Bucket policy enforcement
  - Audit logging

### AI Attestation Service

- **API Security**

  - JWT-based authentication
  - Cookie security with secure and httpOnly flags
  - CORS policy enforcement
  - Rate limiting
  - Input validation and sanitization

- **Database Security**
  - Connection encryption
  - Prepared statements to prevent SQL injection
  - Connection pooling with timeouts
  - Minimal privilege principle

## Security Best Practices

### Development

1. **Code Security**

   - Run `cargo audit` regularly
   - Keep dependencies updated
   - Use workspace-level dependency management
   - Enable all security-related compiler warnings

2. **Testing**

   - Include security-focused test cases
   - Test for common vulnerabilities
   - Validate input handling
   - Check error cases

3. **Configuration**
   - Never commit secrets to version control
   - Use environment variables for sensitive data
   - Maintain separate configurations for development and production

### Deployment

1. **Environment Security**

   - Use minimal base images
   - Regular security updates
   - Network segmentation
   - Firewall rules

2. **Monitoring**
   - Enable audit logging
   - Use OpenTelemetry for tracing
   - Monitor for suspicious activities
   - Set up alerts for security events

## Known Security Considerations

### Hardware Attestation

- TOCTOU (Time of Check to Time of Use) vulnerabilities mitigated through CDI
- GPU isolation requirements
- Hardware capability verification
- Secure device management

### AI Model Security

- Model input validation
- Output sanitization
- Resource isolation
- Compliance verification

## Vulnerability Reporting

### Reporting a Vulnerability

1. **DO NOT** create a public GitHub issue
2. Email security@lotabots.com with:
   - Description of the vulnerability
   - Steps to reproduce
   - Potential impact
   - Suggested fix (if available)

### Response Timeline

- Initial response: 24 hours
- Assessment completion: 72 hours
- Fix implementation: Based on severity
  - Critical: 7 days
  - High: 14 days
  - Medium: 30 days
  - Low: Next release
