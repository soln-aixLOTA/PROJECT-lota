\section*{Abstract}

\sysname{} is a modern, secure, and scalable microservices platform built in Rust, designed to handle hardware attestation, AI model verification, document management, and resource allocation. The system leverages state-of-the-art technologies including Actix-web for high-performance async web services, PostgreSQL and Redis for data management, and comprehensive monitoring through Prometheus and Grafana.

This document presents the refined system architecture, file structure, and technology stack recommendations for \sysname{}. We detail the core components including the API gateway, authentication service, hardware attestation service, document service, and resource management service. Each component is designed with security, scalability, and maintainability in mind, following Rust's best practices and modern microservices patterns.

The platform incorporates robust security measures including JWT-based authentication, bcrypt password hashing, and secure secret management through HashiCorp Vault or AWS Secrets Manager. The infrastructure is designed for cloud-native deployment using Docker and Kubernetes, with comprehensive observability through metrics, logging, and distributed tracing.

This documentation serves as a comprehensive guide for both AI agents and human developers working on the \sysname{} platform, ensuring consistent development practices and maintaining high-quality standards across the project.
