# Manual Code Review: API Gateway

## File: src/main.rs
- **Line(s):**  Inferred from context (handling both authentication and routing)
- **Issue Type:** Code Structure
- **Description:** The main handler function likely handles both authentication and routing, leading to a large, monolithic block of code that is difficult to maintain.
- **Severity:** Medium
- **Recommendation:** Break out the authentication logic into a separate function or middleware. Keep routing logic simpler.
- **Relevant Documentation:** `docs/design/api_gateway_design.md`, `docs/coding-standards.md`

## File: src/errors.rs
- **Line(s):** Inferred from context (errors being swallowed)
- **Issue Type:** Error Handling
- **Description:** Errors are potentially being swallowed without logs, making problems difficult to diagnose.
- **Severity:** High
- **Recommendation:** Use centralized error handling with structured logs. Return meaningful HTTP status codes.
