# Microservices Design Review

## API Gateway
- **Findings:**  
  - The gateway correctly routes requests to user-management, training, and inference services.  
  - Some API routes overlap or contain redundant endpoints. Consider consolidating.
  - Potential for the main handler to be too complex, handling both authentication and routing.

## User Management Service
- **Findings:**  
  - Clear boundary for user authentication and profile data.  
  - Uses event-driven messages to notify other services of new or updated users.  
  - Opportunity to optimize database schema for fewer joins.
  - Strong security design principles are documented, including JWT, RBAC, and input validation.

## Training Service
- **Findings:**  
  - Resource-intensive model training is properly offloaded to GPU nodes.  
  - Consider adding job queuing for scheduling multiple concurrent training requests.
  - Integration with MLflow and Weights & Biases suggests good experiment tracking practices.

## Inference Service
- **Findings:**  
  - Exposes gRPC endpoints for real-time inference.  
  - Evaluate load-balancing strategies to handle higher concurrency.
  - Leverages NVIDIA Triton for efficient model serving.

## Security/Attestation Service
- **Findings:**  
  - Properly checks attestation tokens from NVIDIA environment.  
  - Expand logging to track invalid tokens or suspicious requests.
  - Potential for insecure handling of the NVIDIA Attestation API key.

## Preprocessing Service
- **Findings:**  
  - Utilizes NVIDIA RAPIDS for GPU-accelerated data processing.  
  - Asynchronous job processing is a good design choice for handling potentially long-running tasks.

## General Microservices Design Recommendations:
- **Centralized Configuration Management:** Implement a centralized configuration management system for all microservices.
- **Service Discovery:** Utilize a service discovery mechanism for dynamic service registration and lookup.
- **Circuit Breakers:** Implement circuit breakers to prevent cascading failures between services.
- **Distributed Tracing:** Implement distributed tracing to track requests across multiple services for better debugging and monitoring.
