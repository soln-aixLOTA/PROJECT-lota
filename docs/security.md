# Security at LotaBots

LotaBots is committed to providing a secure platform for our users. We implement the following security measures. For development environment setup, see our [development guide](./development-setup.md). For a project overview, see the [main README](../README.md).

## Authentication and Authorization

-   We use JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for authentication.
-   We implement fine-grained authorization to control access to resources.
-   We use strong passwords and multi-factor authentication.
-   We enforce the principle of least privilege for all user roles.
-   For detailed implementation, see:
    -   [Authentication Guide](./api/auth.md)
    -   [Authorization Policies](./api/authorization.md)
    -   [Role-Based Access Control](./api/rbac.md)
    -   [API Documentation](./api.md#authentication)

## Input Validation and Output Filtering

-   We validate all user inputs to prevent injection attacks and other vulnerabilities.
-   We implement output filtering mechanisms to prevent the generation of harmful or inappropriate content.
-   We use parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection.
-   We implement XSS protection through proper escaping.
-   For implementation details, see:
    -   [Input Validation Guide](./security/input-validation.md)
    -   [Content Filtering](./security/content-filtering.md)
    -   [Database Security](./database-schema.md#security)

## Secrets Management

-   We use a dedicated secrets management system (e.g., HashiCorp Vault, AWS Secrets Manager, Azure Key Vault) to store sensitive information.
-   We do not store secrets directly in the code or environment variables.
-   We implement automatic secret rotation.
-   We maintain an audit trail of secret access.
-   For configuration details, see:
    -   [Secrets Management Guide](./security/secrets-management.md)
    -   [Key Rotation Policies](./security/key-rotation.md)

## Regular Security Audits and Penetration Testing

-   We conduct regular security audits and penetration testing to identify and address potential vulnerabilities.
-   We keep our dependencies up-to-date and scan for vulnerabilities.
-   We perform automated security scanning in our CI/CD pipeline.
-   We maintain a responsible disclosure program.
-   For more information, see:
    -   [Security Audit Procedures](./security/audit-procedures.md)
    -   [Vulnerability Management](./security/vulnerability-management.md)

## Data Protection

-   We encrypt sensitive data at rest and in transit.
-   We adhere to data privacy regulations (e.g., GDPR, HIPAA).
-   We implement secure backup procedures.
-   We enforce data retention policies.
-   For implementation details, see:
    -   [Data Encryption Guide](./security/encryption.md)
    -   [Privacy Compliance](./security/privacy-compliance.md)
    -   [Data Retention Policies](./security/data-retention.md)

## API Security

-   We implement rate limiting to prevent abuse.
-   We use TLS 1.3 for all API communications.
-   We validate API tokens and implement token expiration.
-   We monitor API usage for suspicious patterns.
-   For detailed documentation, see:
    -   [API Security Guide](./api/security.md)
    -   [Rate Limiting Configuration](./api/rate-limiting.md)

## Logging and Monitoring

-   We maintain comprehensive audit logs.
-   We implement real-time security monitoring.
-   We use automated alerting for suspicious activities.
-   We retain logs according to compliance requirements.
-   For configuration details, see:
    -   [Logging Standards](./security/logging.md)
    -   [Monitoring Setup](./security/monitoring.md)
    -   [Alert Configuration](./security/alerting.md)

## Security Policies

-   We follow the principle of least privilege.
-   We implement secure coding practices (see [Development Setup](./development-setup.md#coding-standards)).
-   We require security training for all developers.
-   We maintain an incident response plan.
-   For more information, see:
    -   [Security Policies](./security/policies.md)
    -   [Incident Response](./security/incident-response.md)
    -   [Security Training](./security/training.md)

## Dependency Management

-   We regularly update dependencies to patch security vulnerabilities.
-   We use automated tools to scan dependencies for known vulnerabilities.
-   We maintain a whitelist of approved dependencies.
-   We perform impact analysis before updating critical dependencies.
-   For more details, see:
    -   [Dependency Management Guide](./security/dependencies.md)
    -   [Vulnerability Scanning](./security/vulnerability-scanning.md)
    -   [Development Setup](./development-setup.md#dependency-management)
