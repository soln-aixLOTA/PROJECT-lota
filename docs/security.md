# Security at LotaBots

LotaBots is committed to providing a secure platform for our users. We implement the following security measures:

## Authentication and Authorization

-   We use JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for authentication.
-   We implement fine-grained authorization to control access to resources.
-   We use strong passwords and multi-factor authentication.

## Input Validation and Output Filtering

-   We validate all user inputs to prevent injection attacks and other vulnerabilities.
-   We implement output filtering mechanisms to prevent the generation of harmful or inappropriate content.

## Secrets Management

-   We use a dedicated secrets management system (e.g., HashiCorp Vault, AWS Secrets Manager, Azure Key Vault) to store sensitive information.
-   We do not store secrets directly in the code or environment variables.

## Regular Security Audits and Penetration Testing

-   We conduct regular security audits and penetration testing to identify and address potential vulnerabilities.
-   We keep our dependencies up-to-date and scan for vulnerabilities.

## Data Protection

-   We encrypt sensitive data at rest and in transit.
-   We adhere to data privacy regulations (e.g., GDPR, HIPAA).

## Security Policies

-   We follow the principle of least privilege.
-   We implement secure coding practices.
-   We maintain comprehensive audit logs.
