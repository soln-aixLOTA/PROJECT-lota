# NVIDIA AI Enterprise Integration Review

## Components Under Review
- NGC Containers
- Triton Inference Server
- RAPIDS
- DCGM (Data Center GPU Manager)

## Findings
- Triton is properly leveraged for inference pipelines but lacks robust autoscaling calibration.  
- RAPIDS usage for data preprocessing shows promise on GPU-accelerated nodes.  
- DCGM metrics are collected, but not integrated into a performance dashboard.  

## Recommendations
1. **Autoscaling:** Investigate horizontal pod autoscalers for Triton with GPU metrics from DCGM.  
2. **Dashboards:** Surface DCGM metrics on a Grafana or equivalent analytics dashboard.  
3. **RAPIDS Caching:** Explore caching repeated data transformations for repeated training runs.
