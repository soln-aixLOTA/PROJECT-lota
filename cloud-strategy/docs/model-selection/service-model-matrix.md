# Cloud Service Model Selection Matrix

## Overview

This document provides a framework for selecting appropriate cloud service and deployment models for each workload, considering factors such as cost, security, compliance, and operational requirements.

## Service Model Decision Framework

### Evaluation Criteria

#### Business Requirements

- Time to market
- Cost constraints
- Scalability needs
- Geographic requirements

#### Technical Requirements

- Performance needs
- Integration requirements
- Data sovereignty
- Security requirements

#### Operational Requirements

- Management overhead
- Team expertise
- Support requirements
- Monitoring capabilities

## Service Models Analysis

### Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)

#### Best For

- Maximum control over infrastructure
- Legacy application hosting
- Specific hardware requirements
- Custom security requirements

#### Considerations

- Higher management overhead
- More flexibility
- Complete control over security
- Resource-intensive maintenance

### Platform as a Service (PaaS)

#### Best For

- Rapid application development
- Modern application architectures
- Reduced management overhead
- Focus on application logic

#### Considerations

- Less infrastructure control
- Vendor lock-in potential
- Simplified scaling
- Managed security

### Software as a Service (SaaS)

#### Best For

- Standard business applications
- Minimal customization needs
- Rapid deployment
- Reduced management

#### Considerations

- Limited customization
- Dependent on vendor
- Simplified management
- Cost-effective for standard needs

## Deployment Models

- Regulatory compliance
- Consistent workloads
- Special hardware needs

### Hybrid Cloud

#### Characteristics

- Combined public/private
- Workload flexibility
- Data sovereignty
- Cost optimization

#### Best For

- Mixed workloads
- Regulatory requirements
- Disaster recovery
- Resource optimization

### Multi-Cloud

#### Characteristics

- Multiple providers
- Vendor independence
- Geographic distribution
- Risk mitigation

#### Best For

- High availability
- Provider redundancy
- Geographic presence
- Best-of-breed services
