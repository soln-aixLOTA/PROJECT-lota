- [ ] Monitor spot market pricing
- [ ] Implement fallback strategies

### Resource Optimization

#### Right-sizing

- [ ] Monitor resource utilization
- [ ] Identify over-provisioned resources
- [ ] Implement automated scaling policies
- [ ] Regular right-sizing reviews

#### Storage Optimization

- [ ] Implement lifecycle policies
- [ ] Monitor storage class usage
- [ ] Archive unused data
- [ ] Delete unnecessary snapshots

#### Network Optimization
